# Shopify Section Structure & Customizer Rule

## Section Structure & Design
- Start with a main parent `<div>` that wraps the entire section.
- Inside the parent, add a direct child `<div>` with the class `page-width` (Shopify Dawn theme class).
- Build all content and layout elements inside the `page-width` div.
- Use mobile-first design as the base, and ensure layout adapts for these breakpoints:
  - 0px–767px (mobile)
  - 768px–1023px (tablet)
  - 1024px–1439px (small desktop)
  - 1440px and above (large desktop)

## CSS & HTML Coding
- Write CSS styles first using the Shopify Liquid `{% style %}` tag.
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming for all CSS classes.
- Do not include any comments in the code (CSS, HTML, or schema).
- Do not refer to or use any global CSS variables.
- Use `rem` units for all font-size, margin, gap, and padding properties in CSS (except for media query breakpoints, which should use `px`).
- Do not set font families explicitly. Inherit fonts from the theme's global settings:
  - Headings: inherit from `settings.type_header_font`
  - Body: inherit from `settings.type_body_font`
- Always use a mobile-first approach for all CSS in sections.
- All media queries for breakpoints must use `min-width` (not `max-width`).
- The required breakpoints are:
  - `@media (min-width: 768px)` for tablet and up
  - `@media (min-width: 1024px)` for small desktop and up
  - `@media (min-width: 1440px)` for large desktop and up
- Do not use `max-width` in media queries.
- All base styles should target mobile (0–767px) by default, with overrides for larger screens using the above `min-width` breakpoints.
- Make all CSS selectors unique to the section or block by including the section or block id (e.g., `.section-{{ section.id }}-padding {}`) so that styles do not affect other sections or instances of the same section.

## JavaScript Coding
- Always write all JavaScript code using the Shopify Liquid `{% javascript %}` tag. Do not use `<script>` or other methods for section or block JavaScript.
- Always use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features and syntax, such as `const`, `let`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and modules where possible.

## Shopify Customizer Settings
- Add a setting to change the background color of the parent div that wraps the entire section.
- Add settings to control top and bottom padding of the section.
- Add settings to control left and right padding of the section.
- Allow padding to be set separately for mobile and desktop.
- Use `px` units (not `rem`) for all customizer padding settings.

## Schema & Liquid
- After CSS and HTML, always include the section schema for Shopify section configuration.
- Ensure all customizer settings are included in the schema as per the requirements above.

## Section Settings Grouping
- When applicable and required, group settings in the section schema in the following logical order:
  1. Text Content & Styling (including text color, alignment, formatting, etc)
  2. Image / Video Options
  3. Layout & Styling (background color, container color scheme, max width, etc.)
  4. Section Padding (Mobile, then Desktop)
  5. Advanced/Custom Code

## General
- Do not miss or skip any of the requirements.
- Always act as a Senior Shopify Liquid Developer highly experienced in HTML, CSS, JS & Liquid.
- Never touch the original files. Always create new files or copy the existing ones to use as a starting point.
- Try your best (not mandatory) to make the section or block code self-contained (without creating additional files) so that it can be re-used in other Shopify projects.
